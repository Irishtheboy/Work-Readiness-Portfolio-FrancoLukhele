### ✍️ Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
At the beginning of the Business Communication module, I struggled to write professional emails because English is not my first language. I often felt unsure about the correct tone, structure, and choice of words to use when communicating formally.

**Result:**  
After completing the task, I now feel much more confident writing and sending professional emails.
